# Day 1 - September 16th

Technically the first day is August 27 from 4:20 to 4:25 where we generated the project and setup asdf.
We're mostly starting with boilerplate to get an understanding of where this project should end up.

## Time Tracking

* 12:30am - 1:45am
    * Student
        * Add environment variable .env usage
        * Add req dependency
        * Add Jira search prototype returning results
        * User mode: diary entry to this point
        * It's important to note that this wasn't a novel approach, I had taken a lot of inspiration from [Marc Delagrammatikas' Jira Tracker Project](https://github.com/marcdel/jira_tracker/tree/main/lib/jira). I had also spent some time working with Req previously so this approach was rather quick to pull together.
            * I'm unsure if take home assignments are really meant to have any novel approaches as research or prototyping from nothing can easily eat up a day if you're not careful.
            * Is the idea that a full stack developer should be creating MVPs like this on their own time? It definitely feels like it given the time constraints.
* 1:45am - 2:15am?
    * Instructor
        * Wrote overview starting point and pulled specs and other documentation stubs from Keep Your Secrets.
