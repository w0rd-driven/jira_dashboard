# Day 2 - September 18th

Focusing on "Instructor" time to try to set expectations and guard rails.
By showing screenshots and possibly the original CSS, we want to give students a more complete starting point.
Students can also choose to ignore the design if they'd like to spend more time on something uniquely theirs.
There are no right or wrong answers here really, I just want to emulate the projects I'm used to creating on larger teams with far less time constraints.

## Time Tracking

* 3:00am - 4:30am
    * Instructor
        * Create screenshots by using Screenshot.app
        * Use Photoshop smudge tool to obfuscate issue information.
        * Import screenshots into our documentation entry point.
        * Write up the UI/UX section explaining our design starting point.
