## Overview

A version of this approach took place during an education exercise among the developers at Orange.
This version was done in Laravel over the course of a week. Some of us spent more time than others and we eventually took the best ideas for ourselves later.
I had started using the Laravel example rather extensively as my Jira dashboard before fully embracing "Your Work page" and configurable dashboards.

The primary goal is to treat this as an example of a take home assignment for an agency or consultancy.
The work should ideally take no more than 8 hours or up to 16 if I'm feeling generous with my time and enjoy the work.
The idea being that as developers we should be able to estimate a single day of work to some degree. Things happen, research takes longer than expected.
If I can time box this aggressively I feel like it could be a good onboarding approach.

I've seen a spectrum of take home assignments, like 8 hours including researching a new API like Twilio, designing a layout from absolute scratch, and producing a rather decent MVP.
It will also take a little time management to break apart work I'm doing writing documentation like this as an "instructor" vs the "student" that produces the end result.
